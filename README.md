# longest-palindrome-subsequence

Given a string ‘S’, find the length of the Longest Palindromic Subsequence in it.

# Examples

Input: S = “GEEKSFORGEEKS”
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence we can get is of length 5. There are more than 1 palindromic subsequences of length 5, for example: EEKEE, EESEE, EEFEE, …etc.

Input: S = “BBABCBCAB”
Output: 7
Explanation: As “BABCBAB” is the longest palindromic subsequence in it. “BBBBB” and “BBCBB” are also palindromic subsequences of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.
